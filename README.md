## Description

In this In-Class we will be setting up a Django project from scratch.
Utilizing everything that we have learned so far. In addition, we will see how
to make customer user models, add user authentication, ability to send
emails, permissions and authorization, and how to style our site with
Bootstrap so that it is more appealing to look at. We will also continue to
ensure that our entire project is well tested.
